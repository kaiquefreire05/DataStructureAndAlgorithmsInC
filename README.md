# Data Structure And Algorithms In C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms using the C language. It was developed for educational purposes, allowing developers to understand and practice fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms.

## Implemented Data Structures

- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Trees

## Implemented Algorithms

- Binary Search
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Other Common Algorithms

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kaiquefreire05/DataStructureAndAlgorithmsInC.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```sh
cd DataStructureAndAlgorithmsInC
```
3. Compile the C files using a compiler of your choice, for example, GCC:
```sh
gcc -o output_name source_file.c
```
4. Run the command compiled file:
```sh
./output_name
```
